**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED**  
**Priority:** High  
**Labels:** enhancement, UI/UX  
**Resolved in:** Commit `8f223bd` (2025-08-28)  

## Problem ✅ SOLVED

The UI in control mode was not optimal and looked messy, while the presentation mode looked perfect. Timer circle and modal overlays were covering company information in control mode.

## Expected Behavior ✅ ACHIEVED

- Control mode should have a clean, organized interface ✅
- UI elements should be properly aligned and spaced ✅
- The layout should be as polished as presentation mode ✅

## Issues Resolved ✅

- Messy layout in control mode ✅ Fixed with conditional visibility
- Poor visual hierarchy ✅ Fixed with proper z-index management
- Inconsistent spacing and alignment ✅ Fixed with responsive sizing
- Timer circle covering content ✅ Fixed with smaller control mode timer
- Modal overlays blocking company info ✅ Hidden in control mode

## Acceptance Criteria ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] ✅ Review and redesign control mode UI
- [x] ✅ Ensure consistent styling between modes  
- [x] ✅ Improve visual hierarchy and organization
- [x] ✅ Test across different screen sizes

## Solution Implemented

**Control Mode Optimizations:**
- Timer circle: Reduced from 32x32 to 20x20 in control mode
- Z-index: Lowered from z-30 to z-10 to prevent content blocking
- Position arrows: Hidden in control mode (presentation only)
- Question overlay: Hidden in control mode (presentation only)
- Smooth transitions between modes with proper Alpine.js conditionals

**Technical Changes:**
- Added `presentationMode` conditional visibility throughout Phase 2 UI
- Responsive timer sizing with Alpine.js `:class` bindings
- CSS enhancements for control mode specific styling
- Proper layering to ensure content accessibility
