# Issue #010: Non-functional "Bekijk Details" Button on Celebration Screen

## Status: Open
**Priority:** Low  
**Type:** Enhancement  
**Phase:** Phase 1  

## Problem Description

The "Bekijk Details" button on the Phase 1 celebration screen is non-functional. When clicked, it does not perform any action or navigate to a details view.

## Current Behavior

- ❌ "Bekijk Details" button appears on celebration screen but has no functionality
- ❌ No visual feedback when button is clicked  
- ❌ No navigation or display changes occur

## Expected Behavior

The "Bekijk Details" button should either:
1. Navigate back to the control mode view to show detailed voting results, or
2. Display a modal/overlay with detailed breakdown of all voting results, or  
3. Be removed if not intended to have functionality

## Technical Context

- **File:** `index.html` (celebration screen template)
- **Location:** Phase 1 celebration overlay
- **Button Element:** `← Bekijk Details` button in celebration screen footer

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Define intended functionality for "Bekijk Details" button
- [ ] Implement click handler and associated logic
- [ ] Ensure proper state management when navigating between views
- [ ] Test button functionality across all browser modes
- [ ] Update user guide if new functionality is added

## Priority Justification

**Low Priority** - This is a nice-to-have enhancement that doesn't block core workshop functionality. The celebration screen successfully shows winners and allows progression to Phase 2 via "Start Analyse →" button.

## Labels
- enhancement
- phase-1 
- ui-improvement
- low-priority

## Additional Notes

This issue was identified during Phase 1 testing when strategy tags display was being verified. The "Start Analyse →" button works correctly for Phase 1→2 transition.
