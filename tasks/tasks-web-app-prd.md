### Notes

- Tests should be run using `npx playwright test [optional/path/to/test/file]`
- Use `npx playwright test --headed` to see browser interactions during development
- Each phase must achieve >95% test coverage before proceeding to next phase
- All tests must pass across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge browsers
- LocalForage integration should be tested across all supported storage mechanisms
